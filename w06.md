This week, we are learning Concurrency: Processes and Threads in Operating Systems.

1. [Introduction to Concurrency (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKtvNJQoCNw) <br>
   Lets start off with the video above, Mike explains **what is Concurrency, their uses and real-life examples** briefly. I think the video is good for beginners because it covers Concurrency in general.
   
2. [Summary of Concurrency (article)](https://medium.com/@akhandmishra/operating-system-threads-and-concurrency-aec2036b90f8) <br>
   After watching the previous video, lets get to the summary of Concurrency in the medium link above. Mishra describe **Threads and Deadlocks** which are not explained in the previous video so be sure to read this article üëç

3. [Context Switch and Dispatcher (article)](https://mycareerwise.com/content/context-switch-and-dispatcher/content/exam/nta-net/computer-science) <br>
   One of the key concept in Concurrency is **Dispatching and Context Switching**. But, what are they and how do they work? all of which are explained well in the article above and can be read within 5 minutes.

4. [Interrupt in Concurrency (article)](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/introduction-to-concurrency-interrupts-microcontrollers-embedded-systems/) <br>
   Interrupt has the role to **handle which process to execute out of two or more process at the same time**. Some C code example of Interrupt are available in the above article so lets try them out! üòä

5. [Multi-core Programming (article)](https://vaibhaw-vipul.medium.com/multi-core-programming-809d1569d988) <br>
   After we learned the concepts of Concurrency, we can implement Multi-core programming as a real-life examples. You can read the details in the above link and there is an extra lecture video.
   
6. [Thread Libraries (article)](https://www.brainkart.com/article/Thread-Libraries_9837/) <br>
   Thread Libraries **provides an API for creating and managing threads**. There are 3 main thread libraries i.e. POSIX Pthreads, Win32 threads, and Java threads. Interesting to note is the implementation of threads is based upon whatever OS and hardware the JVM is running on. ü§î

7. [Implicit Threading (article)](https://tutorialspoint.com/implicit-threading-and-language-based-threads) <br>
   Implicit threading is mainly **the use of libraries or other language support to hide the management of threads**. The most common implicit threading library is OpenMP, in context of C, more on the above link.

8. [User Level and Kernel Level Threads (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK6bC-uxpFU) <br>
   In this video, User and Kernel level threads are explained in detail with some animation to helps us understand Threads better. Only 3 minutes!

9. [Amdahl's Law (article)](https://study.com/academy/lesson/amdahl-s-law-definition-formula-examples.html) <br>
   Amdahl's Law has some associations with Concurrency, because Amdahl's Law relates to the **performance improvement of a system with the parts that didn't perform well**. You can read more about Amdahl's Law in the above article.
   
10. [Process & Management (article)](https://applied-programming.github.io/Operating-Systems-Notes/2-Process-Management/) <br>
    Process and their management are described thoroughly in the above link. Really good explanation and furthermore, there are some illustrations to visualize them. üëè
    
Thats it for this week's top ten links, see you next week!
