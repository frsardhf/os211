   For starters, lets watch David's explanation about address in general, how to translate virtual to physical address, page offset and translation examples. A more in-depth material about address than what we have learned in Computer Organization last semester.
   
2. [Common FAQ: Memory Management (article)](https://www.guru99.com/os-memory-management.html) <br>
   Most commonly asked question about Memory Management in OS. Memory Management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory to optimize the overall performance of the system.

3. [How Memory works on Linux (article)](https://linux-audit.com/understanding-memory-information-on-linux-systems/) <br>
   Lets learn how Linux manages its memory and how we can gather memory information in the above link. There are some commands that we can use to check details and information about our memory, such as dmesg and vmstat.

4. [Review Bits, Bytes, and Words (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Weyv-V8xz0c) <br>

6. [Logical vs Physical address (article)](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-logical-and-physical-address.html) <br>
   What are the differences between the two of them? In general, logical address is generated by CPU during a program execution while physical address refers to a location in the memory unit. The details are explained in the above article :)
