Hello everyone, this week we are learning Addressing, Shared Lib & Pointer.

1. [Address Translation (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjKS1IbiGDA) <br>
   For starters, lets watch David's explanation about address in general, how to translate virtual to physical address, page offset and translation examples. A more in-depth material about address than what we have learned in Computer Organization last semester.
   
2. [Common FAQ: Memory Management (article)](https://www.guru99.com/os-memory-management.html) <br>
   Most commonly asked question about Memory Management in OS. **Memory Management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory** to optimize the overall performance of the system.

3. [How Memory works on Linux (article)](https://linux-audit.com/understanding-memory-information-on-linux-systems/) <br>
   Lets learn **how Linux manages its memory** and how we can gather memory information in the above link. There are some commands that we can use to check details and information about our memory, such as dmesg and vmstat.

4. [Review Bits, Bytes, and Words (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Weyv-V8xz0c) <br>
   Lets review about Bits, Bytes, and Words in Memory! We have learned this too back then in Organization Systems but we may have forgotten most of it. In this video, Harry explains them in detail with some examples given there.

5. [Memory Allocation in OS: First-Fit (article)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/first-fit-allocation-in-operating-systems/) <br>
   There are **4 ways to allocate memory** namely, First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit, Next-Fit. This article only describes First-Fit's pros and cons, the rest are in different article though.
   
6. [Logical vs Physical address (article)](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-logical-and-physical-address.html) <br>
   What are the differences between the two of them? In general, **logical address is generated by CPU during a program execution while physical address refers to a location in the memory unit**. The details are explained in the above article :)
   
7. [Makefile and how do they work (article)](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile) <br>
   In general, **Makefile is a set of tasks to be run in our terminal**. It also used _make_ command to compile a program from a source code. In this article, there are some basic examples and advanced as well. The complete reference and examples on makefiles are in the different article in the end of this article, so check them out too!

8. [Static and Dynamic Libraries in Linux (article)](https://medium.com/@StueyGK/static-libraries-vs-dynamic-libraries-af78f0b5f1e4#:) <br>
   There are two libraries in Linux, Static and Dynamic. They are used to **improve reusability in our program**. In the above article, the author tells us the pros and cons of each libraries and how to create them.

9. [More on the Makefile (article)](https://makefiletutorial.com/) <br>
   Lets learn more about makefile in the above link! They are explained from the syntax, variables, wildcard, pattern rules, and many more in colored text. So now we know what makefiles actually do in the Demos.
   
10. [Dynamic Memory Allocation (article)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/) <br>
    There are 4 library functions to facilitate Dynamic Memory Allocation i.e. malloc(), calloc(), free(), and realloc(). To understand them better lets check the explanation and examples of each library in the above article!
    
Thats it for this week's top ten links, see you next week!
